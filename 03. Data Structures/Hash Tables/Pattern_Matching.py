#Given a string and a pattern, write a program to find all occurences of the pattern in the string
#For example, string = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT", pattern = "TEST"
#Output = Pattern found at index 10
#Example 2, string =  "AABAACAADAABAABA", pattern =  "AABA"
#Output: Pattern found at index 0, Pattern found at index 9, Pattern found at index 12

##The naive approach would be to slide over the entire string in windows of length equal to the length of the pattern
#And check every cbaracter if it matches the pattern

        k = 0
        for j in range(i,i+l): #We loop for the length of the pattern

                k += 1
        if flag==0: #If flag is zero,i.e., if we haven't broken out after encountering a non-matching character, we append i to the list as this is where the matched attern starts
            matched_indices.append(i)
        flag = 0 #We reset the flag to be 0 for the next window

#As can be clearly made out this isn't a very efficient solution.
#The outer for loop is of order O(n-m+1) where n is the size of the string and m is the size of the pattern
#And the inner for loop is of order O(m).
#Therefore, overall time complexity is equal to O(n*m) plus we also have some space complexity


#Now, since this problem is not there in the hash tables portion of the course, and I am solving it here, there must be some method using hashing to solve this
#And there is. It is an algorithm known as the Rabin-Karp Algorithm
#In this, we loop over the entire string similarly as our naive algorithm in windows of length equal to that of the pattern
#But we don't compare the characters of every window.
#We calculate the hash value of the pattern and the substring we are checking and start comparing the characters only if the hash values match
#For this, a hash function is required which should be pretty fast and can give the hash value of the substring in the next window,
#by using the hash value of the substring of the present window
#The hash function suggested by Rabin and Karp is as follows:

'''hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) = ( d ( hash( txt[s .. s+m-1]) â€“ txt[s]*h ) + txt[s + m] ) mod q

hash( txt[s .. s+m-1] ) : Hash value at shift s.
hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) : Hash value at next shift (or shift s+1)
d: Number of characters in the alphabet (256)
q: A prime number
h: d^(m-1) '''

#So let's implement this

def rabin_karp(string, pattern, prime):
    n = len(string)
    m = len(pattern)
    h = 1
    d = 256
    p = 0
    t = 0
    flag = 0
    matched_indices = []

    #Calculating h according to formula h = (d^(m-1))%prime
    for i in range(m-1):
         h = (h*d)%prime

    #Calculating the hash values of the pattern and the first window of substring inside the given string
    for i in range(m):
        p = (p*d + ord(pattern[i]))%prime
        t = (t*d + ord(string[i]))%prime

    #Sliding over the string in winows and checking if the hash values match
    for i in range(n-m+1):
        if p==t:
            for j in range(m): #Comparing every character in the substring whose hash value matchs that of the pattern
                if pattern[j] != string[i+j]:
                    flag = 1
                    break #If a non-matching character is found, we break out of the loop
            if flag == 0:
                matched_indices.append(i)
            else:
                flag = 0
        #Calculating the hash value for the next substring
        if i<n-m:
            t = ((t - ord(string[i])*h)*d + ord(string[i+m])) % prime
            #Value of t might turn out be negative, if it does, we add prime to t
            if t<0:
                t = t+prime

    return matched_indices


print(f'Pattern found at {rabin_karp(string,pattern,11)}')
#Pattern found at [0, 9, 12]

#That was complicated!! But it was fun.
#The worst case complexity of this algorithm is unfortunately, no better than the naive one, i.e., O(n*m)
#But the average case time complexity is O(n+m)
