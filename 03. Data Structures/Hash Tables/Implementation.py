#Now although there are some for loops running in the class hash,
#the time complexity is not O(n).
#This is because n stands for the size of the input, which corresponds to number of key,value pairs in the table
#But the for loop in the _hash function runs only for the length of the key, which would be insignificantly small in comparison to the number of entries in general.
#Also, the for loop in the get function runs for the length of the collisioned array, which in most cases, won't be too long
#Atleast nowhere near to the number of total entries, hence the time complexity remains way less than O(n), even less than O(log n) in most cases
#The keys and values methods are slightly worse than O(n) though, as we have to loop over the entire size of the table once,
#And loop over all the lists in the buckets which have collision
