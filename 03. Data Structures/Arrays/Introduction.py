#Arrays are one of the most commonly-used data structures
#The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations
#Arrays are of two types : Static and Dynamic
#Static arrays have fixed, pre-defined amount of memory that they can use, whereas in dynamic arrays this is flexible
#In Python we only have dynamic arrays
#Some basic operations and their complexities are given below :

#Look-up/Accses - O(1)
#Push/Pop - O(1)*
#Insert - O(n)
#Delete - O(n)

array = [5,8,2,9,17,43,25,10]

#Look-up/Acces
#Any element of an array can be accessed by its index.
#We just need to ask for the particular index of the element we are interested in and we will get the element in constant time
first_element = array[0]  #This will return the first element of the array, in this case, 5, in O(1) time
sixth_element = array[5]  #sixth-element = 43 Again, in O(1) time


#Push/Pop
#Push corresponds to pushing or adding an element at the end of the array.
#Similarly, pop corresponds to removing the element at the end of the array.
#Since the index of the end of the array is known, finding it and pushing or popping an element will only require O(1) time
array.append(87) #Adds 87 at the end of the array in O(1) time

#In some special cases, the append(push) operation may take greater time. This is because as mentioned earlier, Python has dynamic arrays
#So when an element is to appended and the array is filled, the entire array has to be copied to a new location
#With more space allocated(generally double the space) this time so that more items can be appended.
#Therefore, some individual operations may reuire O(n) time or greater, but when averaged over a large number of operations,
#The complexity can be safely considered to be O(1)

array.pop() #Pops/removes the element at the end of the array in O(1) time.

print(array)


#Insert
#Insert operation inserts an element at the beginning of the array, or at any location specified.
#This is O(n) operation since after inserting the element at the desired location,
#The elements to the right of the array have to be updated with the correct index as they all have shifted by one place.
#This requires looping through the array. Hence, O(n) time.
array.insert(0,50) #Inserts 50 at the beginning of the array and shifts all other elements one place towards right. O(n)
array.insert(4,0) #inserts '0' at index '4', thus shifting all elements starting from index 4 one place towards right. O(n)

print(array)


#Delete
#Similar to insert, it deletes an element from the specified location in O(n) time
#The elements to the right of the deleted element have to shifted one space left, which requires looping over the entire array
#Hence, O(n) time complexity
array.pop(0) #This pops the first element of the array, shifting the remaining elements of the array one place left. O(n)
print(array)
array.remove(17) #This command removes the first occurence of the element 17 in the array, for which it needs to traverse the entire array, which requires O(n) time
print(array)
del array[2:4] #This command deletes elements from position 2 to position 4, again, in O(n) time
print(array)

array.insert(11, 'shushrut')
print(array)
print("-"*100)

l = [5,8,2,9,17,43,25,10]
print(len)
l.insert(9, "shushrut")
len = len(l)
print(len)


a = 15
b = 15
c = 300
d = 300
