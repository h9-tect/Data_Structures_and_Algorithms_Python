#Find the largest word in a given string
#Examples
#Input: "fun&!! time"
#Output: time

#The simplest and easiest solution that comes to mind is :
#We check for every character if it is an alphanumeric character or not
#If it is, we increase a counter and update a variable which stores the maximum value of counter
#If we encunter a non-alphanumeric character, we reset the counter to zero and start again when the next alpha-numeric character arrives

def easy_longest_word(string):
    count = 0
    maximum = 0
    for char in string:
        if char.isalnum():
            count += 1
        else:
            maximum = max(maximum, count)
            count = 0
    maximum = max(maximum, count)
    return maximum

string = 'fun!@#$# times'
print(easy_longest_word(string))

#This prints the length of the longest word, but after writing this funtion I realized we have to print the  word as well ðŸ˜‚
#We can do that using the same logic as above. Just that we have create two new arrays
#One to hold all the words and another to hold the current word.#Then we'll find the word with maximum length and print that

def naive_longest_word(string):
    count = 0
    maximum = 0
    words = []
    word = []
    for char in string:
        if char.isalnum():
            count += 1
            word.append(char)
        else:
            if word not in words and word:
                words.append(''.join(word))

            maximum = max(maximum, count)

    maximum = max(maximum, count)
    if word not in words and word:
        words.append(''.join(word))
        print(words)
        print(word)
    for item in words:
        if len(item) == maximum:
            return item

print(naive_longest_word(string))
#As can be seen, this has become a pretty complicated solution.
#We loop over every character and check if it is an alphanumeric character.
#If yes, we increase count by 1 and append the character to the word list.
#If not, we first check if the word which we have accumulated so far is their in the words list or not.
#If not, we convert the list word into a string using the join method and add the string to the words list
#If yes, then we ignore it. This is done so that same words are not added more than once in the words list
#Then we reset word to an empty list in anticipation of the next word and count to 0.
#This way by the end of the loop, words contains al the words in the string except for the last one, which we add manually after the for loop
#Finally, we check the length of which word is equal to the maximum value, which has been keeping track of the length of the longest word
#And we return the longest word, albeit only the first occurence , if there are more than one words with maximum length.

#The complexity is bad on all fronts. There is a join function used inside a for loop.
#Complexity of .join(string) is O(len(string)). So overall time complexity is O(mn)
#Also, two new arrays are created. So space complexity = O(m + n)


#A different method to solve this problem can be using Regex,or Regular Expressions
#First we split the string into groups of alphanumeric characters
#Then we find the maximum length among all the words
#Finally we find the word corresponding to the maximum length

    maximum = max([len(item) for item in string])
    for item in string:
        if len(item) == maximum:
