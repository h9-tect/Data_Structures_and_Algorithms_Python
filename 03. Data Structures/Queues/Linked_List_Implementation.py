#Queues are another form of linear data structure very similar to stacks.
#The difference is queues follow the FIFO rule - First In First Out, much like real life queues,
#Where the person gets in first, gets to leave first.
#Quesues can be implemented with both arrays and linked lists but the array implementation is not eficient
#Because for removing an element from the queues, which happens from the front of the array(queue),
#the indices of the array have to be updated every time, essentially making it an O(n) operation,
#Whereas the same operation can be done in O(1) time with linked lists.
#Queues have enqueue and dequeue operations which correspond to the push and pop operations of stacks , only difference being dequeue removes element from the front
#Time complexities are as follows:
#Peek - O(1)
#Enqueue - O(1)
#Dequeue - o(1)


#Like for stacks, we need a node class which will contain the data and a pointer to the next node
class Node():
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None


#Next we need the Queue class itself which will contain a constructor initialising the queue and then the methods we require
class Queue():

#The 'first' pointer will always point to the front of the queue, the element which is to be removed next that is
#The 'last' pointer will always point to the end of the queue, i.e., the element which has last been entered
    def __init__(self):
        self.first = None
        self.last = None
        self.length = 0

#Now comes the peek method which will return the element at the front of the queue
    def peek(self):
        return self.first.data

#The enqueue operation will add an element at the end of the queue
#If the queue is empty, it will make both the first and last pointer point to the new node
#Else, if will first make the next of the new node to point to the present last node and then it will update the last node to point to the new node
#Time complexity will be O(1)
    def enqueue(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.last == None:
            self.last = new_node
            self.first = self.last
            self.length += 1
            return
        else:
            self.last.next = new_node
            self.last = new_node
            self.length += 1
            return


#Next comes the dequeue operation which removes the front element of the queue
#If the queue is empty, it will print an apropriate message
#Else, it will simply make the first pointer point to the next element of the first pointer.
    def dequeue(self):
        if self.last == None:
            print("Queue Empty")
            return
        if self.last == self.first:
            self.last = None
        self.first = self.first.next
        self.length -= 1
        return

#Finally we'll create the print method which prints the elements of the queue in, well, a queue like format
    def print_queue(self):
        if self.length == 0:
            print("Queue Empty")
