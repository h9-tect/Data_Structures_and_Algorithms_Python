#Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls
#and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
#In Python there's a module named functools with a method lru_cache() which allows us to use this optimization technique
#First, we'll implement memoization on our own with an example function, then with the help of lru_cache
