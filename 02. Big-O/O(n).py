#Total running time of the funchallenge function =
#O(1 + 1 + n + n*1 + n*1 + n*1 + 1) = O(3n +3) = O(3(n+1))
#Any constant in the Big-O representation can be replaced by 1, as it doesn't really matter what constant it is.
#Therefore, O(3(n+1)) becomes O(n+1)
#Similarly, any constant number added or subtracted to n or multiplied or divided by n can also be safely written as just n
#This is because the constant that operates upon n, doesn't depend on n, i.e., the input size
#Therefore, the funchallenge function can be said to be of O(n) or Linear Time Complexity.
